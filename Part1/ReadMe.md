# Hacking Medical Physics. Part 1. Working with DICOM data

## Overview ##

The demo scripts, data and documents in this folder are provided to accompany the EMP News Winter 2021 article *Hacking Medical Physics. Part 1.*

Contents of this folder (in addition to this ReadMe file and the license file):

**atcmMatlabLive.m** - annotated live MATLAB script (mlx-file) for producing a plot like that published in the article

**atcmMatlabLive.pdf** - exported pdf file of the MATLAB live script

**atcmMatlabClassic.m** - an uncommented MATLAB classic script (m-file) for producing a plot like that published in the article

**atcmPythonJupyter.ipynb** - annotated Jupyter notebook for Python (ipynb) for producing plots like that published in the article

**atcmPythonJupyter.html** - exported html file of the Python Jupyter script

**Phantom** - a folder containing DICOM files for a CT scan of a [CCT228 ATCM phantom](https://www.phantomlab.com/atcm-phantom) (Phantom Laboratories, Greenwich, NY, USA)

## Acknowledgements ##

The display of the longitudinal ATCM data is inspired by the article:

Merzan D, Nowik P, Poludniowski G, Bujila R. Evaluating the impact of scan settings on automatic tube current modulation in CT using a novel phantom. *Br J Radiol.* 2017;90(1069):20160308.

The MATLAB code owes a debt to the code written by Patrik Nowik that can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/DRPWM/code/src/master/chapter11/). The CT scan data is also from that repository and we gratefully acknowedge Patrik for making it available.
