# Hacking Medical Physics. Part 2. Working with databases—a step beyond spreadsheets

## Overview ##

The demo scripts, data and documents in this folder are provided to accompany the EMP News Spring 2022 article *Hacking Medical Physics. Part 2.*

Contents of this folder (in addition to this ReadMe file and the license file):

**dbMatlabLive.m** - annotated live MATLAB script (mlx-file) for producing a plot like that published in the article

**dbMatlabLive.html** - exported html file of the MATLAB live script

**dbMatlabClassic.m** - a minimally-commented MATLAB classic script (m-file) for producing a plot like that published in the article

**reports** - a folder containing fictitious dose reports in Excel (xls) format

## Important note ##

This folder contains fictitious staff data from a fictitious vendor. Remember that if you process any data that contains genuine personal information, you should follow your local rules implementing the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or the equivalent legislation where that does not apply. Further, the quality assurance necessary for any software you write will depend on the purpose for which it is used. This applied to both the code in this repository and any you write yourself.
